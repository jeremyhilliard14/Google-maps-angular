#Google Maps App

###Thi app is built using JavaScript, JQuery, CSS and makes calls with the Google Maps API.  The user can look up details off the 39 most populated cities in the United States.  There are buttons to zoom into the selected cities.  The user can also bring up driving directions for each city and then search for campgrounds in the area.
